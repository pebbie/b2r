B2R (Binary to RDF) tools to make SPARQL query on binary data using file format knowledge

A continuation of File Format Analyzer (https://code.google.com/p/formalizer/) and File 
Format Encyclopedia (wotsit.org) as semantic web service. 

hoped to answer issue on [1]:

"If Linked Data contains information about resources that are most naturally expressed in non-RDF formats 
(be they __binary__ such as pictures or videos, or human readable documents in XML formats), those 
non-RDF formats should be __just as easy to publish__ to the LinkedData server as the RDF relations 
that link those resources up. A LinkedData server should therefore allow publishing of 
non linked data resources too, and make it easy to publish and edit metadata about those resources."

--
not every data should be stored as RDF triple, 
in order to link two person of different religion 
both need to speak the same language 
but not necessary having the same religion
